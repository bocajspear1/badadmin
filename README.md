# BadAdmin

## About

### What is BadAdmin?

BadAdmin is an application that is built to make a computer or virtual machine vulnerable to attacks for computer security practice. It uses numerous modules that each installs random vulnerabilities on the target.

### Why BadAdmin?

The Internet can provide numerous vulnerable virtual machines for computer security students, researchers, competition creators, and professionals. However, most of these can be used once, since after being used, their secrets and problems are already known. If we try to attack or defend these boxes again, we learn much less. It can also create imbalances in  competitions between those who already have used the virtual machine and those who have not. 

BadAdmin hopes to fix these problems by allowing the generation of random vulnerabilities on a system each time BadAdmin is run, thus a more unique experience each time.

## Development

Development is still in progress for both the application and documentation. Detailed design documents and class documentation is in the works.

If you are interested in this project and want to get involved, feel free to contact me at `jacob (-a-t-) j2h2.com`, and I will get back to you as soon as possible.

Also, feel free to tell me of any ways to make the project more accessible, as the more modules, the more learning that can happen!
